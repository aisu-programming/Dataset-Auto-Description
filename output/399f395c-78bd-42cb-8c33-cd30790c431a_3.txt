Column profiling: 
Column Time Stamp is a time column with temporal resolution in minute. The temporal coverage is from 2002-11-02 to 2003-01-13. 
Column Average Wind Speed is a http://schema.org/Float. The range of values is from 0 to 33.3. 
Column Standard Deviation is a http://schema.org/Float. The range of values is from 0 to 3.8. 
Column Average Wind Direction is a http://schema.org/Integer. There are 16 distinct values. The range of values is from 0 to 338.0.
