\end{Input}

\begin{InputB}
Column Time Stamp is a time column with temporal resolution in minute. The temporal coverage is from 2002-11-02 to 2003-01-13. 
Column Average Wind Speed is float. The range of values is from 0 to 33.3. 
Column Standard Deviation is float. The range of values is from 0 to 3.8. 
Column Average Wind Direction is interger. There are 16 distinct values. The range of values is from 0 to 338.0. 
\end{InputB}

\begin{Question}
Given these 9 aspects:
1. Can you describe the dataset in one sentence?
2. What does the dataset look like?
3. Can you group the headers?
4. What are the value types and value ranges for the most important headers?
5. Where is the data from?
6. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention time?
7. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention location?
8. Is there anything unclear about the data, or do you have reason to doubt the quality?
9. Is there anything that you can point out or analyse in more detail?
Describe the dataset in sentences by viewing these 9 aspects.
\end{Question}

\begin{Answer}
The dataset is a collection of wind speed and direction measurements from a weather station at an airport in Denmark. The data is collected every minute, and covers a period of about 2 months. The data is stored as a CSV file with headers for the time, average wind speed, standard deviation, and average wind direction.
