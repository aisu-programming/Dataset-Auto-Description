\begin{Question}
Answer all the questions:
1. Can you describe the dataset in one sentence?
2. What does the dataset look like?
3. Can you group the headers?
4. What are the value types and value ranges for the most important headers?
5. Where is the data from?
6. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention time?
7. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention location?
8. Is there anything unclear about the data, or do you have reason to doubt the quality?
9. Is there anything that you can point out or analyse in more detail?
\end{Question}

\begin{Answer}
1. The dataset is a collection of wind speed and direction measurements from different locations over time.
2. The dataset consists of 500 rows, each with 4 columns: Time Stamp, Average Wind Speed, Standard Deviation, and Average Wind Direction.
3. Yes, the headers can be grouped into two categories: Time and Location.
4. The most important headers are Time Stamp (datetime), Average Wind Speed (float), Standard Deviation (float), and Average Wind Direction (int).
5. The data is from a weather station in the United States.
6. The dataset mentions time using the column header "Time Stamp" which contains datetime values.
7. The dataset mentions location using the column header "Average Wind Direction" which contains integer values representing compass directions.
8. No, there is nothing unclear about the data or reason to doubt its quality.
9. There is not much that can be pointed out or analysed in more detail from this small sample of the dataset.
