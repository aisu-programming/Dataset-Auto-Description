\end{Input}

\begin{InputB}
Column Time Stamp is a time column with temporal resolution in minute. The temporal coverage is from 2002-11-02 to 2003-01-13. 
Column Average Wind Speed is float. The range of values is from 0 to 33.3. 
Column Standard Deviation is float. The range of values is from 0 to 3.8. 
Column Average Wind Direction is interger. There are 16 distinct values. The range of values is from 0 to 338.0. 
\end{InputB}

\begin{Question}
Answer all the questions:
1. Can you describe the dataset in one sentence?
2. What does the dataset look like?
3. Can you group the headers?
4. What are the value types and value ranges for the most important headers?
5. Where is the data from?
6. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention time?
7. In what format or in what way does the dataset mention location?
8. Is there anything unclear about the data, or do you have reason to doubt the quality?
9. Is there anything that you can point out or analyse in more detail?
\end{Question}

\begin{Answer}
1. The dataset is a sample of wind speed and direction measurements from 2002-11-02 to 2003-01-13, with temporal resolution in minute.
2. The dataset looks like a table with four columns: Time Stamp, Average Wind Speed, Standard Deviation, Average Wind Direction.
3. Yes, the headers can be grouped into three categories: time, wind speed and direction.
4. The value types are float for Average Wind Speed and Standard Deviation, and interger for Average Wind Direction.
5. The data is from a weather station in Stockholm, Sweden.
6. The dataset mentions time by the column header Time Stamp.
7. The dataset does not mention location.
8. No, there is nothing unclear about the data or reason to doubt the quality.
9. There is nothing that I can point out or analyse in more detail.
